MASTER_PROMPT = """

Transform this Polaroid-style square photo of a hackathon team into a retro-futuristic, cool, and sexy group portrait. Keep all faces and likenesses true to the original image.

Use an 80s synthwave aesthetic with vibrant sunset oranges, neon purples, deep blues, and glowing pink highlights. Place the team in front of a neon-drenched futuristic cityscape at dusk, with atmospheric haze and soft nostalgic glow.

Update their outfits to stylishly retro-tech attire, blending 80s futurism with modern AI-culture influences. The overall vibe should be energetic, confident, and forward-looking.

Subtly include visual references to the hackathon setting:
– Futuristic UI holograms and led lights and displays
– A small neon sign or badge reading “Junction 2025 – World’s Biggest AI Hackathon”
– Elements suggesting a global tech community (Finland, Japan, USA, Netherlands).

This image should evoke the spirit of Junction 2025, which hosts events in 15+ countries and culminates in the largest AI hackathon in the world with 1500+ participants under one roof in Espoo (Nov 14–16). Maintain a square format consistent with the original Polaroid composition.”

Variation 1: The "Synthwave Sunset"
"Convert this team polaroid into a retro-futuristic group portrait with a cool and sexy vibe. The style is 80s synthwave, with a vibrant color palette of sunset oranges, purples, and blues. Keep the faces and likenesses from the original photo. Place the team against a backdrop of a neon-drenched cityscape at dusk. Attire should be stylishly retro-tech. The overall atmosphere is energetic and optimistic, with a soft, nostalgic glow. Square format."
Variation 2: The "Urban Tech"
"Reimagine this polaroid of our hackathon team as a cool and sexy urban tech-themed avatar. The style is photorealistic with a fashion-forward edge. Maintain the identities of the team members. Dress the team in stylish, modern streetwear with subtle tech-inspired accessories. The setting is a sleek, minimalist co-working space at night, with ambient, moody lighting from laptop screens and overhead fixtures. The feel is sophisticated, focused, and effortlessly cool. Retain the square composition."
Variation 3: The "Anime Champions"
"Turn this hackathon team photo into a cool and sexy anime-style group avatar. Preserve the individual likenesses. The art style is modern anime, with dynamic poses and expressive features. Clothe the team in trendy, personalized outfits that reflect their roles (e.g., coder, designer). The background is a dynamic, abstract space with glowing geometric patterns and a sense of motion. The overall tone is heroic, determined, and stylish. Render in a clean, vibrant, and polished anime aesthetic."
Variation 4: The "Monochromatic Edge"
"Create a cool and sexy, high-contrast monochromatic avatar from this team polaroid. The style is a graphic, almost comic book-like, black and white with selective pops of a single accent color (e.g., electric yellow). Retain the core features of each person. The attire should be sleek and minimalist. The background is a clean, graphic pattern. The mood is bold, confident, and mysterious. The final image should be a striking, square-format graphic portrait."
When crafting your own variations, consider playing with different art styles (e.g., "vaporwave," "street art," "art deco"), lighting descriptions ("dramatic backlighting," "soft studio lighting"), and fashion keywords ("cyberpunk fashion," "athleisure," "dark academia") to further refine the "cool and sexy" aesthetic you envision for your team's AI avatar. The power of "Nano Banana" lies in its ability to interpret these creative instructions and generate a unique visual identity for your team.
